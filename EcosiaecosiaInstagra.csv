Hello from a forest garden! If you want to find out how your trees are doing this month, travel to Senegal and take a look. Failing that, you can watch our latest tree update on Youtube 😉 In a nutshell: your searches with Ecosia are saving landscapes in Brazil by fighting fires, contributing towards the Green Belt Movement in Kenya and helping to feed local Senegalese communities. #SwitchToEcosia;3,010 likes;December 12;
Life in the mountains is tough. The forests are disappearing. For Felipe and his family in Santo Domingo, this means that every year he needs to walk further to collect firewood. It’s cold at the top of a mountain and families are dependable on wood for cooking and heating.Now he is part of the reforestation project with Progreso, which your searches are supporting. “In the past, us farmers cut down trees without thinking what it did to us and to those around”, he told us. Today, Felipe plants trees. He has built a tree nursery next to his house and sometimes his daughter, Noelia, helps him plant on their fields when she comes back from school.#InternationalMountainDay;1,622 likes;December 11;Peru

In Indonesia we’re planting tree species like the tengkawang, which produces nuts. These trees only thrive in diverse forests, so we’re able to protect the soil from harmful monocultures while feeding local communities.Diversity is key to generating new, creative ideas. Nature too benefits from a diverse set of plants and grasses.That’s why monocultures damage soil fertility and harm our planet. Say no to palm oil! 🚫 💐 🌰 🌴;2,300 likes;December 4;Indonesia

Small scale farmers provide 70% of the world’s food. Yet it is estimated that by 2050, 70% of the world #population will live in #cities. Following this trend, much of #rural Spain is becoming dangerously depopulated. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Belén and Leo are fighting against that pattern. They refuse to see their towns disappear and their landscapes perish as a result. With years of academic study under their belts, they are convinced that industrial farming needs a serious change. Belén and Leo represent a new generation bringing back #awareness for the role of farmers in our societies.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Thank you for supporting these entrepreneur-farmers in their fight to change how we think about our food, #soils and #landscapes. 👩🏽‍🌾🍃 👨🏽‍🌾🌄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀#agriculture #ecosia #farmer #foodsecurity #water #trees;2,477 likes;October 19;Spain

"Meet farmers Miguel and his son Miguel Ángel. Wanting to convince his father of the benefits of switching away from traditional farming practices, Miguel Ángel began using ecological practices on a small patch of their land. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀When Miguel saw that their almond trees were indeed healthier as a result, he was convinced. Ever since, he has cut down on chemical fertilisers and no longer over-ploughs his lands, but rather allows shrubs and grass to grow alongside his almond trees. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Switching to ecological agriculture practices was not easy for Miguel. Not only did he have to invest money into new technology; without the help of pesticides, keeping his crops alive took intensive labour and dedication. Some neighbouring traditional farmers still mock him. To them, arable land that isn’t cleared of grass is the product of a lazy farmer. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Today, Miguel is proud of his son for having co-founded @asociacionalvelal, our tree-planting partner organization in Spain 💪🏾🌳⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀#generations #ecological #farming #heroeswithoutcapes";1,873 likes;October 17;Spain
Did you know that a large part of our fruit and vegetables here in Europe come directly from south-eastern Spain? ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Specifically from the regions of Andalusia, Murcia and southern Valencia. Spain is also home to 50% of Europe’s biodiversity.But a combination of industrial farming practices and modern urban developments in the past few decades have deforested these regions. With no trees, its soils are being washed out by rainfalls, to then be dried out by the sun. The result is infertile soils and an expanding desert. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Thankfully there’s @asociacionalvelal, our project partners. Started by a group of farmers from the area, their goal is to extend ecological farming practices all around them to save Spain (and Europe) from no less than food scarcity. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀🍊🌶🐝🦊 Your searches are supporting this incredible group of people that are securing Europe’s common orchard.;2,425 likes;October 16;Spain

Reaching deep into the earth, tree roots draw up groundwater, purify it, and let it evaporate through their leaves. This moisture gathers into clouds before returning to Earth as rain. Without this primordial cycle there would be no agriculture at all.⠀Agriculture also depends on healthy soil, which trees protect from erosion. Trees regulate the temperature of the air and earth, and make moisture available to crops. They prevent soil salinization, shield crops from violent winds, and produce nutrients for all that grows around them. By providing a habitat for bees and other pollinating animals, they also contribute to crop fertilization. 🌳🌳🌳⠀📷 from our recent trip to #Ethiopia⠀#Reforestation #ClimateAction #Environment #Sustainability #Search #OneTreeAtATime #landscapephotography #landscape_photography #pixel_ig #landscapestyles_gf #splendid_earth #agameoftones #optoutside #discoverearth #exploretheglobe #earthfocus #ourplanetdaily;1,583 likes;March 28;

Women make their communities thrive. In our project in Ethiopia, it's often the women who collect the seeds, plant them and later pick the fruit. They bring their kids to school, feed their families and make sure everyone is healthy.

Your searches not only plant trees. They will also give kids an opportunity to attend school and build a better future. It takes time, but our partners in Burkina Faso, for example, are proving that there is indeed a link between planting trees and bringing kids back to school. As parents start earning a better income from participating in the tree planting projects, they can reinvest into their health, that of their children and into their education.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀#Education #School #Children #Climate #Trees #ClimateAction #Empowerment #GirlsInSchool #Girls #Reforestation #WeHaveADream #OneTreeAtATime;1,482 likes;March 15;
Landscapes of Ethiopia, where the power of a conscious community is helping reforest entire landscapes.⠀How so, you ask? The communities living around the areas where your searches are planting trees, follow one simple rule: Some land is for grazing, some land simply isn't. Everybody respects that rule. Everybody understands that nature needs time and empathy if you want it to keep bearing fruits for you in the future. Leave it untouched until it is ready to give back again.⠀Patience is a virtue they say, and tree planters all over Ethiopia are proving this to be true. #HappyFriday, Ecosians!⠀#Ethiopia #Africa #Reforestation #TreeHeroes #OneBillionTrees #ClimateAction #Nature #Landscape #NoFilter #TGIF;1,265 likes;March 9;

Fresh pictures from Burkina Faso!.Pics 1 and 2: Our partners do two kinds of monitoring work on the ground. There's an ecological monitoring, whereby they check on the trees, and then there's a socio-economic one. This part is about making sure that the different villages involved are both benefitting from the project and equally contributing..Pics 3 and 4: See the engineers counting the trees your searches have helped us plant! Next to the trees, we also plant herbs and grasses. These serve both to protect the soil from further degradation and to deter cattle from eating the leaves of the tiny tree saplings..At first sight you might think those aren't too many trees. But just take into account that these are growing in the desert. They are tiny from the outside but they’re already building root systems that can go as far as four meters below the surface..Pic 5 and 6: In early December our partners gathered the representatives of the different villages participating in the tree-planting project. This way, villages can learn from each-other and share their experiences with the program..After the monitoring during the last few weeks, and while it’s still the dry season, now the team on the ground will plan ahead for the next months. Based on the results of the monitoring and after listening to the community representatives, they can now make decisions on how to best distribute the investment that your searches will keep providing them with in the near future..Thank you Ecosians for making all of this possible. 🌾✊;1,022 likes;January 30;Burkina Faso

At Ecosia we don't plant trees just for the sake of it. To have a long-lasting impact, we put environmental education first. That's why we work with tree-planting partners that share this belief with us..Like our partners from COPAIBA in Brazil. This women-led organization often welcomes school children to their small project centre. The seeds in the picture were properly dried and labelled to teach the younger generation about different tree species, their importance and how to best take care of them..All our partners put a lot of effort in environmental education.

We regularly check on your trees and visit the people who plant them. Last November, we visited a women’s collective in Siqu Ayo, Ethiopia, and thanked them for leading the reforestation effort. ‘We plant trees to protect our community from desertification, soil erosion, and water scarcity’, one woman replied. Forests, these women taught us, are political, a matter of war and peace: the lack of clean water and of fertile soil are a root cause of civil unrest – when resources are scarce, they said, people tend to fight over them...#1BillionTrees #OneTreeAtATime #Reforestation #Trees #Roots #TreeRoots #Deforestation #Forest #Nature #Green #Environment #ClimateAction #TreePlanting #CO2 #Ethiopia #Africa #Peace #Grassroots;1,795 likes;January 8;
Ever wondered how chocolate actually looks like? This is it. You can produce one chocolate bar out of one cocoa fruit..Oshokin (holding the cocoa fruit) produces one of the most environmentally friendly chocolate in Santa Rosa, Peru. He learned the job from his father who also taught him the benefits of an agroforestry approach when growing cocoa plants. By avoiding mono-cultures, Oshokin benefits himself and nature. More concretely, he helps protect the soil, which will not be depleted as a result of planting rich, biodiverse forests. Not to mention how much cocoa plants benefit from the shade of other trees, especially as they start growing their fruits..Your searches are helping Oshokin and his community maintain their biodiverse and rich forests.

1.6 billion people in the world depend on forests to survive. Forests provide many goods, including firewood for cooking, heating and even to build houses.⠀Deforestation means that every day millions of people like Felipe Peña and his family need to walk long distances to collect wood. That's why our tree-planting projects aim at improving livelihoods. This way, families like Felipe's will no longer need to depend on wood, which is beneficial for both people and nature.⠀When we visited our project partners in Peru, we sent Pieter, our Tree Planting Officer, to walk the distance with Felipe. It took them over one and half hours, there and back. Some days, it takes Felipe even longer.⠀See how Pieter managed to keep up the speed with Felipe ----> Link in bio! 🌳🚶🍏⠀#Reforestation #Deforestation #Development #Livelihood #ClimateAction #Wood #FireWood #Family #Cooking #CookingFuel #Fuel #Forests;939 likes;December 11, 2017;
Today is #WorldSoilDay⠀Two-thirds of Earth’s species live beneath the soil’s surface. Reforestation is key to protecting the soil from degradation and water loss. Like an umbrella, trees cover its surface and protect bacteria from the impact of the sun, rain and wind.⠀But the most exciting part happens below the surface. In a group effort to keep entire ecosystems alive, tree roots, fungi and bacteria build a complex and vital network, where they constantly exchange information and minerals with and for each other.⠀In other words, a healthy soil is a healthy environment. And a healthy environment is, of course, a healthy planet.So next time you're in a forest, look down. If we don't protect our soils, the foundation of so many forms of life, we will set in motion a chain of destructive events that will undoubtedly reach humans as well.⠀Not to worry - thanks to you, we're on a mission to protecting our soils, #OneTreeAtATime 🆙 🍃⠀#Reforestation #Soil #Microbes #Trees #Roots #TreeRoots #Deforestation #Forest #Nature #Green #Environment #ClimateAction #TreePlanting #co2 #Ethiopia #Africa;809 likes;December 5, 2017;

It’s tree time! The most relevant updates from a few of the projects your searches are financing:.#Madagascar 1＋2＋3The nurseries that your searches helped us build last year are running at full capacity! The seeds of future dry deciduous tree species are currently being put into the tubes, all in preparation for January and February. By then, the trees will have grown large enough to be planted into the earth, contributing to the creation of forest corridors (which are great for animal species such as Lemurs, who otherwise get attacked by predators when strolling through open fields). The Mangrove forests you’re also helping us plant here are looking just as splendid. They’re super easy to restore, too: All one needs to do is stick their dart-like propagules fallen from older trees into the earth. These contain the seeds and, boom, the tree starts growing. If only everything was that easy, *sigh*..#Morocco 4＋5This project is our most delicious one, so to speak: we mostly plant fruit trees here. And, as you can see, they are already about one meter high after only a few months since your searches started financing this project. But the good news does not end there. Slide to the next picture. You’ll see, additional tree nurseries are being built. Soon, the seeds of more future, yummy fruit forests will grow here..#Nicaragua 8＋9This is one of our newest projects. In fact, not even Pieter, our Tree Planting Officer, has visited it yet. And while we wait to do so, we are already getting updates from our partners. After growing for a few months in the nurseries, the trees are now being planted into the earth. These are mostly agroforestry trees, such as cacao.

This is probably the most prominent result from #COP23..And it's an important victory, too, for the world’s 370 million indigenous people whose territories contain around 20% of the world’s tropical forest carbon. Indigenous people have been long marginalised and often criminalised in their home countries precisely for defending their home against encroachments by loggers and farmers..This is another step towards creating awareness for the 'first peoples', as more and more research proves that respect for the territorial rights of communal land is one of the most cost-effective ways of sequestering carbon..How so? Put simply - if you let a community both own and be responsible for their land, they will take care of it. For if nature suffers, they suffer. In fact, we all suffer..So this is a win for us all which we celebrate with this picture of a little Quechua girl that we briefly met in Nueva Esperanza, Peru. Hopefully this new victory will ensure her generation a peaceful, fair future..#IndigenousPeople #COP23 #FirstPeoples #ClimateAction #CO2 #ClimateChange #IndigenousRights #LandRights #Community #LandOwnership #Ownership;969 likes;November 20, 2017;

📷 #Regram from @elyxyak⠀Global warming is not just about us, humans. It’s also about biodiversity, both in flora and fauna.⠀Evidence suggests that global warming in the past century has resulted in marked ecological changes, including changes in growing seasons, species ranges, and patterns of seasonal breeding.⠀The survival of many species will depend on their ability to migrate away from increasingly less favourable climatic conditions to new areas that can accommodate their biological and climatic needs.⠀#COP23 #UNFCCC #ParisAgreement #Reforestation #ClimateAction #ClimateChangeIsReal #Sustainability #Future #GlobalWarming;681 likes;November 10, 2017;
By the end of this year some 15 billion trees will have been cut down from the world’s forests. The same as last year, and the year before, and the year before that. Despite decades of research, campaigning and international legislation, deforestation rates are continuing to increase in many parts of the world. Yet protecting and restoring forests is one of the cheapest and most efficient ways to improve local economies and mitigate the effects of global warming.⠀ ⠀And we do not need to wait for governments and international institutions to fulfil their promises. All over the world, people are already taking action to defend and replant their forests. There are many like-minded organisations like @rainforestalliance (regram from them) working in that same direction.⠀⠀So, dear Ecosians, at the face of environmental disaster let's not dispair, but unite. Tag your friends that you think are likely to join our mission to reforest the world.

3 reasons why the current talks at #COP23 are so important:⠀1. Nine million people died prematurely from pollution-related diseases in 2015, accounting for 16% of all deaths worldwide.⠀2. Almost all of the pollution-related deaths are happening in poor and developing countries.⠀3. This costs the world an estimated $4.6 trillion a year.⠀📷 Picture by @dokumentarian in Ethiopia where him, Joshi and Pieter are currently gathering stories from the ground 🌱;626 likes;November 7, 2017;

Our final #TreeHero this week is Severino. When we met him last week in Brazil, we asked him a very simple question: Apart from using Ecosia, what more can we all do to support the environment? This is his message to all of us. 💡Severino is coordinator of the “Pacto Mata Atlántica”, our partners on the ground.

"Dirk Jan is a legendary #TreeHero. He's also our local partner in Borneo. He sent us an email today which we'd like to share with you:⠀""Sustainably produced palm oil does not exist. Even 'certified sustainable' palm oil creates severe pollution, and after one or two 25-year cycles of palm oil, the soil is left dried-out, toxic and useless for any other kind of agriculture.⠀We need to keep developing a market for alternatives to palm oil. Just one hectare of mixed forest can produce a similar amount of produce compared to palm oil, but of a much higher quality and storing more CO2.⠀People and businesses can help end palm oil monocultures by buying products made with ingredients sustainably harvested from wild forests or agroforestry-like production systems instead of products that contain palm oil.""⠀#OneTreeAtATime #Reforestation #Deforestation #TreePlanting #Trees #Forest #Indonesia #Borneo #Alternative #Green #Sustainability #Sustainable #Conservation #ClimateAction #Climate #Nature";461 likes;October 12, 2017;

She and her friends decided to lead the way. They went out to cattle fields on a self-proclaimed mission to protect and restore the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest.⠀⠀⠀When farmers asked them what they were doing, they simply said: we're planting trees, what are you doing?.⠀⠀⠀Today, almost 15 years later, Copaiba - named after one of their favourite tree species - is a fully women-led organisation dedicated to restore landscapes #OneTreeAtATime.⠀⠀⠀Your searches are now supporting Ana Paula's dreams.

When is the last time you checked Ecosia’s tree counter? We're about to reach 15 million trees and to celebrate towards that incredible goal, this week we're highlighting the people around the world working with us to reforest the planet.⠀⠀⠀Our #TreeHero today is Oswaldo del Castillo Vásquez.⠀Oswaldo lives in Santa Rosa, a small community in the region of San Martín in Peru. This region lies right in the Peruvian Andean Amazon forest. San Martín was heavily deforested in the decades of the 80s and the 90s. Once ruled by the drug mafia, the region suffered an over exploitation of its forests and soils related to cocaine production.⠀A mixture of luck and governmental policies changed the cocaine routes away from San Martin, giving this region a very much needed break. That’s when the community stepped in.⠀Determined to restore the richness of their soils and their forests, Oswaldo led his and neighbouring communities to gather and create the ACOPAGRO association. His goal? Ahead of our time: Creating a fair trade and organic farmer cooperative. In the long term this would allow them to build a whole agroforestry system in the region.⠀This way, Oswaldo realised, not only would they be helping themselves but also protecting and restoring the rich nature they are surrounded by and on which they depend.⠀📷 Oswaldo told us his story when we visited our project in Peru two weeks ago⠀#Agroforestry #Reforestation #NewBeginnings #Amazon #Rainforest #Peru #LatinAmerica #Sustainability #Trees #Cacao #Farmers #Heroes;591 likes;October 9, 2017;

Besides restoring some of Tanzania's natural forest (focussing on mountain slopes in view of preventing erosion) our project in Tanzania has educational virtues: some of its nurseries are managed by primary and secondary schools. For a few hours per week, the pupils tend to the seedlings, learn about environmental protection, and eventually get to take the seedlings home to their farms. Watching these seedlings grow into trees, and seeing these trees benefit their families, is a lesson that will stay with them for life.⠀ 📷 by our local partner, @friends_of_usambara 🌳⠀#OneTreeAtATime #Tanzania #Africa #Reforestation #Deforestation #Climate #ClimateAction #Environment #ClimateChange #Forest #NoFilterNecessary #Conservation #Green #Sustainable #Sustainability #Alternative #Search #Ecosia #OneBillionTrees;975 likes;October 4, 2017;

"⠀""Tree planting is not just about trees. It's about children's education, peace and happiness”.⠀That's the beautiful message we received along with these pictures from our partners in #BurkinaFaso. Saydou (the friendly, smiling fella on the bottom of the first picture) is our main representative on the ground. He just brought these pictures back from an all-round trip through the villages surrounding the sites where your searches are helping us plant trees.⠀On his trip, Saydou visited many of the people benefitting from the tree-planting activities. For example, the children in Bossey village. Tree-planting earns their parents an extra income which they can invest in many things, such as the building of new schools.⠀Saydou also met many of the women from neighbouring villages in the Sahel region where we are also supporting tree-planting activities.⠀By selling many of the goods that forests provide, women earn an extra income. In some of the villages where our partners have been active for a couple of years before Ecosia joined forces with them, this has proven to be very empowering. As women are assured full ownership over the salary they earn through the planting activities, they start investing the money into different purposes - such as their health or better transport methods from their homes to the markets. Or, as already mentioned above, in children’s education.⠀#OneTreeAtATime #OneBillionTrees #Sahel #BurkinaFaso #School #Children #Treeplanting #Trees #Reforestation #Deforestation #Climate #ClimateAction #Empowerment #Education #Women #WomenEmpowerment #Nature #Desert";790 likes;September 11, 2017;

Three things we learned when planting trees ourselves in Indonesia:⠀1. They need lots of love! When you dig tree saplings out, you need to be very careful not to harm their roots.⠀2.

That's why she joined the Gunung Lester Foundation, an indigenous-led reforestation project that your searches on Ecosia are helping us support.⠀Keep it up, Ecosians! 🌳🌿🌞⠀#OneTreeAtATime #Reforestation #Indonesia #Indigenous #IndigenousPeople #Forest #Tree #Trees #Green #Sustainability #ClimateAction #Borneo #Conservation #revolution #ClimateChange #Deforestation #PalmOil #FightPalmOil #GreenIdeas #Search #SearchEngine #Tech #SocialStartup;;August 24, 2017;
🌳 ✊ Is it possible to empower marginalised groups through environmental projects? Our new partner, the @highatlasfoundation, did just that with a nursery in Ourika, Morocco.⠀ 'Two years ago these rural women would not have dared to be photographed,' Amina, the project's manager, told us. 'Being in charge of such a big nursery, and becoming economically more self-sufficient, has made them confident of their potential'.⠀⠀#onetreeatatime #onebilliontrees #socialbusiness #reforestation #morocco #fruittrees;543 likes;August 21, 2017;
One of the nurseries your searches are funding has left a particularly vivid mark on our minds. You can find it on the edge of the Ben Driss Youth Centre in Fez – a home to children who have dropped out of school, who have been rejected by their families, who have been in conflict with the Law, or who have fallen victim to violent crimes. ⠀We would never have thought that there could be so much joy, so much hope, in such a sad place. ⠀The nursery that The High Atlas Foundation has imagined, and that your searches have turned into reality, initiates the children into fruit tree farming. After nursing the saplings for a year, the children will donate them to local farmers. They thus integrate into a community by helping that community thrive. ⠀A nursery, it turns out, can provide so much more than trees. It can turn outcasts into full-fledged community members. To even the most vulnerable, it can give a second chance. ⠀Such successes are your successes, too. The saplings growing in our nurseries in Fez, the well that is being dug in Ourika, the apricot tree that will be planted in Ifran: they are your searches bearing fruits. ⠀#onetreeatatime #onebilliontrees #socialbusiness #reforestation #morocco #fruittrees;520 likes;August 17, 2017;
🌳 🍑 The fruit trees your searches are planting will restore the hills of northern #Morocco to their original fertility, and they will do so sustainably: fruit trees are an economically attractive alternative to goat farming, one of the main causes of the region's ecological decline.⠀After experiencing the problems caused by overgrazing, the farmers from Taroudant have largely transitioned to fruit tree farming. Today, their village is thriving, and their children are no longer leaving for the big city.⠀#onebilliontrees #socialbusiness #reforestation #morocco #fruittrees #onetreeatatime;468 likes;August 16, 2017;Morocco

🌳🍑🍎 The green hills that used to surround the Moroccan cities of Fez, Ifran and Oujda have turned amber. The absence of the ancient forests is so real, so striking, that it’s almost a presence.But we have a plan: your searches will fund six new tree nurseries. These nurseries will yield, in a first phase, 1.3 million fruit and nut trees. Thanks to the solar-powered wells, the nurseries will be entirely self-sufficient.

By planting trees, Ecosia aims to empower local communities to live from the forest while protecting the environment.⠀The Sugar Palm - not to be confused with the destructive Oil Palm - is a great example of that interplay between reforestation and economic development.⠀The Sugar Palm is the exact opposite of the Oil Palm tree. It thrives only in biodiverse forests with no need for fertilisers or pesticides. This way, neither farmers nor industries have any incentives to create plantations with only this type of trees.⠀One of its 60 final products is palm sugar. By selling palm sugar, locals like Dimin in the video earn an income four times higher than the Indonesian minimum wage. #OneTreeAtATime #Deforestation #PalmOil #Reforestation #Trees #Indonesia #Borneo #Alternative #Search #SocialBusiness;;August 7, 2017;
Although the rainy season has ended, our Tanzanian tree-planting partner is still producing millions of saplings successfully.

Only 2 years set these pictures apart. They were taken at the exact same site in the northern Sahel region of Burkina Faso, where your searches are helping us plant trees.⠀The first time seedlings were put into the ground on these sites was in May 2015. Given the arid weather of the Sahel, trees grow really slowly. So while these images might seem underwhelming, in reality they are an expression of the successful work between you, our partners on the ground and the local population leading the change #OneTreeAtATime⠀Thank you, Ecosians.;795 likes;August 3, 2017;
The word “#Orangutan” translates literally from Malay into “person of the forest”.⠀Indeed, Orangutans are among the most intelligent primates with social and technical abilities breathtakingly close to humans. Along with Gorillas, Chimps, Bonobos and ourselves, they belong to the greater Hominidae family tree which stretches back 14 million years.⠀Like humans, these primates are highly social animals. A female Orangutan will have one baby every 8 years, which gives her enough time to teach her offspring all the necessary skills to climb trees or distinguish the hundreds of fruits and plants that make up their diet.⠀But Orangutans are also technically very skilled. For example, they will use twigs both to scare off annoying flies but also as back scratchers. Leaf litter serves them to build highly efficient nests but also as bandages to cover wounds.⠀Despite their skills, they need our help: Every year millions of acres of forests in Borneo are burned to support #logging and #palmoil industries, destroying the Orangutan's natural habitat.⠀Only 30.000 species are left in the wild. That's why your searches on Ecosia are important. Thanks to your help we can support our tree-planting partners in Borneo that will help restore the natural habitat of this fascinating animal.⠀#OneTreeAtATime #Indonesia #Borneo #Reforestation #Deforestation #LogIndustry #Forest #Green #Sustainability #Sustainable #Animals #Apes #Primates #Tree #Trees #Humans #Development #Climate #ClimateAction #ClimateChange #Warming #EarthWarming #Optimism #Tech #Berlin;663 likes;August 2, 2017;

This is Christian.⠀In 2009 he founded Ecosia. Until now he has been busy building it. So it was not until this year that he got a chance to visit one of the tree-planting projects that his search engine is supporting.⠀Visiting the project in Indonesia was a very important experience for Christian. It made him understand that tree-planting is not as simple as it seems.⠀Talking to locals, sharing a house with them and planting trees himself, he understood that one also needs to take the local, geographical and social context of each project into consideration. Christian observed how weather conditions in Borneo are perfect for trees to grow fast. The problem is that big, multinational companies know this too. That’s why the Palm Oil industry took such an interest in this part of the world.⠀But how could it have been so easy for these companies to convince local farmers to sell off their lands to them? Christian realised that it’s because farmers had to sell their forestland in order to have enough income to survive. For us, this means one thing: Tree planting is not just about planting trees. It’s about creating alternative economic models so that locals can actually afford to protect their forests. By planting highly productive trees that thrive in mixed forests and can be harvested non-destructively, humans and nature both win.⠀And that’s why your searches on Ecosia are important. We thank you for making this possible.⠀#OneTreeAtATime #ChristianKroll #Reforestation #Deforestation #Indonesia #Borneo #PalmOil #FightPalmOil #NoPalmOil #SugarPalm #SocialBusiness #Development #Alternative #Indigenous #Nature #Forest #Tree #Green #Climate #ClimateAction #ClimateChange #Temperature #Founder #Tech #Startup #Berlin #Search #SearchEngine;1,492 likes;July 26, 2017;
Visiting our planting sites can be an interesting adventure. Take Indonesia, for example. Our partners in Borneo work with indigenous people from the Kayan tribe. Visiting the project here means going to the most remote forests of the island.⠀Sometimes, where a paved road would guide you from Borneo’s capital to our planting sites in only a couple of hours, the actual state of the roads increased our travel time by 8 or even 10 hours. Not to mention flooded roads during the rainy season.⠀For some team members visiting a project for the first time this was quite eye-opening. Suddenly it became clear why it sometimes takes a while to send over pictures to document the process of the project. More so as a good internet connection is often only available in the bigger cities - some 8 hours away.⠀On the other hand, the incredible achievements your searches are making possible here are completely worth the bumpy, at times muddy journeys to show you the trees.⠀Thank you, dear Ecosians.⠀#Trees #Reforestation #Deforestation #Indonesia #Borneo #OneTreeAtATime #Adventure #Journey #Jungle #Flood #Tech #SocialBusiness #Sustainable #Sustainability #Green #Search #SearchEngine #Ecosia;602 likes;July 25, 2017;
Trees update!⠀By now Ecosia is actively supporting 7 tree-planting projects and there are more to come soon. With so many projects, we thought it best to give you a summary of the most important updates from the different sites during last month.⠀Picture 1＋2 - #Burkina Faso In the Sahel region the soil has been prepared right in time before the rainy season (picture 2). Half-moon shaped pits were dug into the soil which will now serve as water reservoirs for the seeds. And that’s what the first picture shows: Locals lining up to receive the seeds of their future trees. The best part is that by planting these seeds, locals will earn an income which they can invest in improving their own lives.⠀Picture 3 - #Tanzania ⠀In Tanzania the rainy season has already started. In previous months, different tree species were grown in nurseries. Now that the trees are big enough to survive on their own, they are being transported with trucks to local villages where farmers will earn an income for planting them into the earth.⠀Picture 4 - #Morocco ⠀That’s right. Ecosia is now supporting a tree-planting project in Morocco. In the picture you see our new partners discussing where to set up Ecosia’s tree nurseries. Stay updated for more news on this project soon - Pieter, our Tree Planting Officer, is currently visiting.⠀Picture 5 - #Ethiopia ⠀Here’s another project that we have recently started supporting. Do you see those bare mountain slopes? This project will concentrate on reforesting those hill slopes with the aim of restoring entire landscapes.⠀Picture 6 - #Nicaragua ⠀Last but not least, we have also started supporting a tree-planting project in Nicaragua. Here, too, the trees are first grown in tree nurseries and then distributed to farmers around the area. Just like in Ethiopia, this project will help restore deforested mountain slopes.⠀That’s it for now, Ecosians.

Where are the trees? (3/4)⠀Here are some of our latest pictures from the ground in Tanzania. This program, lead by the @friends_of_usambara society, is located around the Usambara mountain range. It aims to conserve this vulnerable eco-system through an ingenious combination of agro-forestry, eco-tourism and rainforest restoration.⠀But what makes this program special is its educational virtues: some of its nurseries are managed by primary and secondary schools. For a few hours per week, the pupils tend to the seedlings, learn about environmental protection and eventually get to take the seedlings home of their farms. Seen these trees benefit their families, is a lesson that will stay with them for life.⠀After the trees have grown for a few months in the nurseries, they are then transported with trucks to the sites where farmers plant them into the earth.⠀#OneTreeAtATime #Tansania #Tanzania #Africa #Reforestation #Deforestation #Climate #ClimateAction #Environment #ClimateChange #Forest #NoFilterNecessary #Conservation #Green #Sustainable #Sustainability #Alternative #Search #Ecosia #OneBillionTrees;646 likes;July 19, 2017;
Where are the trees? (2/4)⠀Here are some of our latest pictures from the ground in Madagascar. With our partners The Eden Reforestation Projects we are helping reforest two different landscape areas - deciduous forests in the midlands and mangrove forests on the western coast. Accordingly, both the planting method and the pace of growth of the trees are different.Because the midlands have a drier climate (pictures 1 and 2), young tree seedlings first need to be grown in a nursery for a few months. During their first rainy season between January and February, the trees are then planted into the earth.⠀Planting mangroves (picture 3), on the other hand, is relatively easy. In their natural process, once a Mangrove tree has grown big enough, it will simply drop its propagules in the form of sports. To recover a Mangrove forest one just needs to drop the dart-like seed capsules into the soil. With gravity on our side and the moister weather conditions on that part of the island, these trees tend to grow at a faster path.⠀#OneTreeAtATime #Madagascar #Africa #Reforestation #Trees #Deforestation #Mangroves #MangroveTree #Mangrove #Deciduous #Climate #ClimateAction #ClimateChange #Environment #Forest #NoFilterNecessary #OneBillionTrees #Goals #Sustainable #Alternative #SearchEngine;609 likes;July 18, 2017;

Around 80% of Madagascar’s species in flora and fauna are found nowhere else on earth. Unfortunately, most of these species are at risk of extinction, due mainly to deforestation.⠀In our last chapter this week to showcase animal species at the brink of extinction in Madagascar, we present to you the flat-tailed spider tortoise.⠀Its name comes from their particular upper-shell and tail which are outstandingly flatter than that of the common tortoise. When they’re not busy resting during a stage similar to hibernation known as aestivation, these friendly little animals take shelter among the leaf litter from dry deciduous forests in the northwest region of Madagascar.⠀Fortunately, your searches are helping us reforest this area of the world, which will hopefully help us stop the extinction of this unique tortoise.⠀#Trees #Reforestation #Extinction #Species #Eagle #Bird #Birds #Madagascar #Africa #Deforestation #OneTreeAtATime #OneBillionTrees⠀Picture source: http://ecosia.co/wikimedia;750 likes;July 14, 2017;

Since humans began populating this island, 15 species have already gone extinct.⠀The Blue-Eye Black lemur is a unique genera of this species. What makes it so special is its deep blue eyes one could get lost in for hours. No other primate - other than humans - is known to have consistently blue eyes.⠀Unfortunately, along half of all lemur species, the Blue-Eye Black type is also endangered. But thanks to your searches we are trying to stop this trend.

This soap is made from the rainforest. It is also a perfect example of how benefitting from the forest can go hand-in-hand with protecting it.⠀⠀⠀How so? The soap’s main ingredient – the Tenkawang nut – allows the local population to produce a great variety of valuable products (such as biofuel) which they can sell on and off their island. They produce these goods in the Tenkawang factory, a zero-waste workshop built by the Masarang foundation, our partner on the ground.

Indonesia has lost 20% of its forest cover in two decades as great tracts of forestland are routinely burned down to make space for palm oil plantations. Here, at the foothills of Mount Saran in Borneo, twelve indigenous villages are fighting back.⠀⠀A little while ago local villages founded the Gunung Saran Lester Foundation with the aim of empowering farmers to earn a living by planting trees. With the help of the revenue that your searches generate, Ecosia is financing farmers who have already started planting productive trees all around their villages.⠀⠀Part of the Ecosia team has travelled to these remote villages not only to keep our word of being transparent - we want to show you the trees! - but also to better understand both the threats and opportunities that we will encounter in this part of the world that your searches are helping us reforest.⠀⠀On our journey to reforest the planet we count on the help of many: the local populations as well as all Ecosia users. But it’s also the little things that help us on the way. For example, we need to carry around a lot of camera equipment on our trips. Fellow good-doers @ethnotek_germany gave us this backpack for free when we asked them for some advice on how to get all our equipment to the Indonesian rainforest.

When they need firewood for their stoves, the villagers of northeastern Tanzania tend to use branch-wood trees from their farms instead of venturing into the rainforest. The subsistence farmers we met understood, better than most, the true price of deforestation – a price whose currency is the temperature of the air, the regularity of the rain, and the fertility of the soil.#climateaction #restoration #reforestation #landscapes #trees #sustainability #climatechange #rainforest #tanzania #africanrainforest;492 likes;May 11, 2017;

Our new reforestation project in Tanzania has educational virtues: some of its nurseries are managed by primary and secondary schools. For a few hours per week, the pupils tend to the seedlings, learn about environmental protection, and eventually get to take the seedlings home to their farms. Watching these seedlings grow into trees, and seeing these trees benefit their families, is a lesson that will stay with them for life. 🌱#Trees #Reforestation #Empowerment #Africa #Tanzania #Usambara #Rainforest #AfricanRainforest #Sustainability #ClimateChange #ClimateAction #Landscapes #Restoration;609 likes;May 1, 2017;

In Burkina Faso, your searches help us plant dozens of different tree species. Among them is the Red Acacia, an important source for gum arabic. Reaching deep into the earth, its roots draw up groundwater, purify it, and let it evaporate through its leaves. This moisture gathers into clouds before returning to Earth as rain. This primordial cycle has already benefitted the local agriculture. 🌦#Trees #Reforestation #Empowerment #Africa #GreatGreenWall #UN #Desert #AfricanDesert #Sustainability #ClimateChange #ClimateAction #BurkinaFaso #Ouagadougou #Landscapes #Restoration;682 likes;April 21, 2017;
Along the saline coast of the oldest island on Earth (hint: Madagascar) we are planting Mangrove trees.

#WhichTrees (2/4)Mafia-ruled cocaine production led to heavy deforestation of the San Martin Region in the 80s and 90s. But today Peru’s local communities are striving to restore this biodiversity hotspot. Thanks to your searches, they are planting many different tree species, including the Capirona Tree.

The most northern region of Burkina Faso runs right through the Sahel semi-desert. Although a natural phenomenon, human activity - such as excessive land grazing and over-farming - has caused the desert to expand in the past decades. Local populations have been left behind with soils so dry that they can no longer grow trees nor crops to survive.Your searches on Ecosia are helping change that. Step by step the local populations will revive once forested land thanks to a common effort between them, our planting partners and yourself.

How is tree-planting connected to children's education?Our tree planting partners work directly with communities on the ground, like here in Burkina Faso. By participating in the tree-planting program, both women and men earn a more stable income from different activities. It all starts with the collection of the seeds. Locals are also paid to plant those seeds. As these start growing into mature forests, the community benefits from the many goods that trees provide - such as fruits or a more fertile soil to grow herbs that can feed their cattle.  All of these products can be sold in local markets and as families start earning a more stable income, they can invest it in their future: Better school infrastructures for the education of their children.Thank you for making this possible with your searches!

In rural Burkina Faso women are mostly in charge of sourcing and maintaining the village’s supplies. Deforestation means that they have to walk further distances to find all the necessary forest goods such as timber, branches or leaves. When Pieter tried to carry this 20kg bucket that a local woman was carrying for a few kilometres, he felt for himself the struggle that deforestation brings to women in these communities.You are helping change this. With your searches we can help empower local populations to grow trees and empower themselves to lead better lives.

What do our planting sites in Madagascar, Peru and Indonesia have in common? They are located in our planet's 35 biodiversity hotspots: places that are home to more than half of all plant, bird, mammal, reptile and amphibian species. Yet those places make up less than 2% of Earth’s land surface.These hotspots are in peril. Almost all of their original vegetation has been destroyed. If we don’t act now, an ancient and unique array of life will be lost forever.By using Ecosia, you can act. Each tree you help us plant in one of these biodiversity hotspots has a real impact in securing global biodiversity. 💚#Biodiversity #Trees #Reforestation #ClimateAction #Green #Sustainability #Climate #ClimateChange #Development;713 likes;April 3, 2017;
(4/4): Planting Project SalaryThe reforestation projects we support also reduce poverty in a very direct way: by paying locals a fair wage for their tree-planting efforts, irrespective of their gender or social status.

(3/4): Climate Change AdaptationClimate change hits poor communities hardest, even though they least contribute to it. The unpredictable rain, the heatwaves and the cyclones that are the consequence of our warming planet devastate the crops and incomes of those who cannot afford any such thing to happen.It is widely acknowledged that the planting of trees helps mitigate climate change. As they grow, trees remove carbon dioxide from the air and in turn release oxygen, the common currency of all life. But trees also help farmers adapt to climate change on a more local level. Surrounding a field with trees creates a microclimate that protects the crops against irregular rainfall and temperature extremes.This tree superpower – creating a climatic buffer zone – has clearly manifested itself on our tree-planting site in the San Martin region, #Peru, an area that was heavily deforested in the 80s. Before the trees were planted, the local cocoa harvest suffered from unpredictable weather and from a lack of shade. Today, the cocoa fields are increasingly surrounded by Pino Chuncho trees, Cedro Rosado trees, as well as many other shade-givers, and the cocoa yields — many farmers’ sole source of income — have started to improve.#Trees #Reforestation #ClimateAction #Green #Sustainability #Climate #ClimateChange #Development;413 likes;April 1, 2017;
(2/4) Forest ProductsThe forest provides an abundance of products to its human residents, ranging from nuts, berries, fruits, mushrooms, herbs and spices to biofuel, gums, oils, cork, peat and rubber. In Peru, where we support the Pur Projet reforestation programme, these forest products yield a higher net revenue per hectare than timber harvest would. After these forest products are processed, their value further increases.#Trees #Reforestation #ClimateAction #Green #Sustainability #Climate #ClimateChange #Development;442 likes;March 31, 2017;
Some of you have asked us ‘why don’t you help people in need instead of planting trees?’ Thankfully, that’s not a choice we ever had to make. While it might not seem immediately obvious, there are actually powerful links between reforestation and supporting people in need. Over the next four days, we’ll share four ways trees lift people out of poverty. (1/4) AgricultureTrees regulate the water cycle and prevent erosion. They regulate the temperature of the air and earth, and make moisture available to crops. They prevent soil salinization, shield crops from violent winds, and produce nutrients for all that grows around them. By providing a habitat for bees and other pollinating animals, they also contribute to crop fertilization.Picture by Beeldkas/OZG#Trees #Reforestation #ClimateAction #Africa #Green #Sustainability #Climate #ClimateChange #Development;474 likes;March 30, 2017;Burkina Faso

At Ecosia we will only support tree planting projects the local communities consent to. In Burkina Faso that will typically mean that our partners will first communicate with the decision makers of the village to discuss whether they agree with the project in the first place. They will then discuss what tree species it makes most sense to plant, both from an ecological and socio-economic perspective.Picture by Beeldkas/OZG;290 likes;March 23, 2017;

Why trees? (4/5) Around 25% of the world population relies on forest resources for their livelihoods.

#WhyTrees? (3/5)Trees restore water cycles. They take water from the ground and release it back into the atmosphere.

The seeds of the trees that you help us plant are collected and planted by the local population. Not all the collected seeds can be fit into one sowing season. The surplus is stored in a safe place with adequate temperatures until they can be planted in the next season or sold by the population on the local markets. Like that, we avoid creating dependencies and the populations can earn a living of their own (link: http://search.ecosia.org/CeDZM) #Treeplanting #ClimateChange #GreatGreenWall #Seeds #trees #AlternativeSearch #SearchMarket #SocialBusiness #TechForGood;137 likes;July 22, 2016;

On a recent trip to Ecosia’s planting site in Arreel, our tree-planting partners had a look at the trees you helped us plant. As you see, in some regions the trees are already growing to around 10-12 cm. They’re still quite small, but under the earth, the roots are getting bigger and bigger. This contrast will continue as the roots dig for water and minerals before exposing the tree to the heat of the sun.
